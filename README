Project implements the routing protocol in Java.
In this project, you will implement a distance-vector routing protocol called RIPv2.
Each node on the network executes RIP to exchange routing information with its neighbors,
and based on this information, a node computes the shortest paths from itself to all the
other nodes and the external internet.
We will assume in this part of the project that the nodes cannot move, but may “disappear” and “reappear”.

It supports 1) active RIP as a router
2) handling incoming route messages
3) CIDR
and 4) route message broadcasts.
We assume that only RIPv2 is used.

Also, the route update time is set to 5 seconds, not 30 seconds as defined in the RFC, to reduce the convergence time,
and 10 seconds for a node to be determined as offline. If a node fails, other nodes should respond to recover routes
if alternate routes are available. The neighbors of a failed node should detect that the failed node is indeed unreachable
and set the appropriate distance to infinity. This information will be propagated to the entire network through the RIP
routing protocol. As you probably know, triggered updates need to be invoked for fast recovery, and split horizon with
poisoned reverse needs to run to prevent the count-to-infinity problem.
